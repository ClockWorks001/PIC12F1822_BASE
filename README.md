# PIC12F1822 BASE Project.
---
This is a base & demo sample project for PIC12F1822.

## Description

The [PIC12F1822][1] is a small 8-bit microcontroller.

## Prerequisites

I created this project using the free versions of the following tools:
 * [Microchip MPLAB X][2] (v2.3)
 * [Microchip XC8 Compiler][3] (v1.32)
 * [MPLAB Code Configurator][4] (installed as plugin within MPLAB X)

You will need to download and install these tools appropriately before you
can open this project and build it.
I use the [Microchip MPLAB PICkit3 In-Circuit Debugger][5] to program
the chip and debug it.
